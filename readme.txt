Stepwise solution to Run a PHP file in XAMPP
Step 1
Go to the Apache Friends website and download XAMPP for Windows. For the easiest install, download the Basic Package's "self-extracting RAR archive." Wait for the download to finish and open it to begin installing XAMPP. Click the "Install" button to start the file extraction. When the Command Prompt screen appears, press the "Enter" key at every question to accept default settings.

Step 2
Start the XAMPP program. When started, XAMPP loads itself into your icon tray. The icon is orange with a white bone-like shape in its center. Single-click the icon to expand the Control Panel. Click on the "Start" button next to "Apache" to start your Apache Web server. When Apache is running, the word "Running" will appear next to it, highlighted in green. Also start "MySQL" if your PHP scripts depend on a MySQL database to run.

Step 3
Place your PHP files in the "HTDocs" folder located under the "XAMMP" folder on your C: drive. The file path is "C:\xampp\htdocs" for your Web server. Make sure your PHP files are saved as such; they must have the ".php" file extension. Open up any Web browser on your desktop and enter "localhost" into the address box. The browser will open a list of files stored under the "HTDocs" folder on your computer. Click on the link to a PHP file and open it to run a script.
